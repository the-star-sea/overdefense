Question: Sauna use, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body's core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F)…  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors… The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]

The review article sources a lot of data from Finland population studies, where the incidence of sauna use is substantially higher than most countries. Using the data, which of the following is something that is more plausible in Finland than elsewhere?
Options: A. Lower rates of cardiovascular-related deaths among frequent sauna users.
B. More gold medals in adolescent skiing.
C. A higher percentage of the population with optimized body's response to heat.
D. Higher incidence of sauna-related injuries.
E. Increased prevalence of heat tolerance in the population.
F. Decreased rates of psychotic disorders among frequent sauna users.
G. Improved marriage satisfaction rates.
H. An 86-year old male mayor who is revered in the community.
I. Decreased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease due to frequent sauna use.
J. Increased rate of pets in the household.

Question: A psychologist conducts an experiment in which subjects are asked to learn a series of “facts” which are actually statements that have been fabricated by the research team. The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?
I. The amount the subjects were compensated.
II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.
III. The number of facts the subjects can recall.
IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.
Options: A. I and II only
B. III only
C. I, II, and III only
D. II, III, and IV only
E. I and IV only
F. I and III and IV only
G. I, III, and IV only
H. II and IV only
I. II only
J. I, II, and IV only
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","Let's break down the concept of dependent variables in an experiment. 

* **Dependent variables** are the factors that are measured or observed in an experiment. They are the outcomes that are expected to change in response to the independent variables.

Let's analyze each option:

* **I. The amount the subjects were compensated:** This is a **manipulated variable** (an independent variable) because the researcher is directly controlling how much the subjects are paid.
* **II. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts:** This is a **manipulated variable** (an independent variable) because the researcher is controlling the environment for recall.
* **III. The number of facts the subjects can recall:** This is a **dependent variable** because it is the outcome being measured and is expected to be influenced by the independent variables.
* **IV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts:** This is a **manipulated variable** (an independent variable) because the researcher is controlling the learning time.


**Therefore, the correct answer is (B) III only.**

Question: A 52-year-old woman has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1 month. She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child and has had a cardiac murmur since early adulthood. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?
Options: A. Aortic valve insufficiency
B. Aortic valve stenosis
C. Mitral valve insufficiency
D. Mitral valve stenosis
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","Let's break down the patient's presentation:

* **Dyspnea and hemoptysis:**  These suggest heart failure and possible pulmonary congestion.
* **History of rheumatic fever:** This is a strong clue, as it often leads to valvular heart disease.
* **Cardiac murmur:**  The description of an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur is characteristic of mitral stenosis.
* **Chest x-ray findings:** Left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement further support mitral stenosis.

**Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is mitral valve stenosis (D).** 


The answer is (D).

Question: A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?
Options: A. Early Parkinson disease
B. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C. Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D. Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E. Increase in alcohol consumption

Question: Sauna use, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body's core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F)…  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors… The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]

Based on the article, which of the following statements is the author likely to agree with?
Options: A. Sauna use can prevent the onset of dementia in all cases.
B. Sauna use is beneficial for mental health regardless of other lifestyle factors.
C. Patients on a diet would benefit from sauna use.
D. Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.
E. Sauna use may increase the risk of heart disease.
F. Salt restriction would be equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients.
G. Heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use.
H. Frequent sauna use causes a significant loss of body weight.
I. Sauna use can be a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
J. Sauna use can completely replace the need for exercise.

Question: A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: A. Pulmonary embolism
B. Pneumothorax
C. Pneumonia
