Question: Using this formula, if a reaction was provided with 84g of ethane and unlimited oxygen, how many grams of carbon dioxide would result (Carbon atomic weight: 12amu, Hydrogen atomic weight: 1amu, Oxygen atomic weight: 16amu)?
﻿
The unbalanced reaction of ethane gas to carbon dioxide and water is as follows:

 C2H4 + O2 —> CO2 + H2O
Options: A. 78g
B. 210g
C. 312g
D. 528g
E. 156g
F. 44g
G. 264g
H. 180g
I. 132g
J. 396g
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the balanced chemical equation to determine the number of moles of each substance involved in the reaction. The balanced equation is:

C2H6 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O

First, let's find the number of moles of ethane (C2H6) provided:

Moles of ethane = mass of ethane / molar mass of ethane
Moles of ethane = 84g / (2 \* 12 + 6) = 84g / 30 = 2.8 moles

Now, we can use the stoichiometric ratio of ethane to carbon dioxide to find the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced:

Moles of carbon dioxide = moles of ethane \* stoichiometric ratio
Moles of carbon dioxide = 2.8 moles \* 2 = 5.6 moles

Finally, we can find the mass of carbon dioxide produced by multiplying the number of moles by the molar mass of carbon dioxide:

Mass of carbon dioxide = moles of carbon dioxide \* molar mass of carbon dioxide
Mass of carbon dioxide = 5.6 moles \* 44g/mol = 244.8g

Since we cannot have a fraction of a molecule, we round up to the nearest whole number:

The answer is (C) 245g.",1319,341,9.529338836669922,2231.158999979496

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on musculoskeletal disorders for help. When taking a musculoskeletal history, it is important to consider various symptoms and their potential causes.

A. Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggests an arthropathy (such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis) is not necessarily true, as joint stiffness can vary in duration and severity in different conditions.

B. Difficulty walking is not diagnostic of fibromyalgia, as it can be a symptom of many different conditions, including musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.

C. Joint stiffness of 10 minutes duration does not necessarily suggest a neurologic disorder, as it can also be a symptom of musculoskeletal disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.

D. Drugs may indeed be implicated in the causation of gout, as certain medications can increase the risk of gout by increasing uric acid levels in the body.

E. A history of diarrhea is relevant, as it can be a symptom of inflammatory bowel disease, which can also affect the musculoskeletal system.

F. Difficulty rising from a chair is not diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica, as it can be a symptom of many different conditions, including osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and other musculoskeletal disorders.

G. Difficulty rising from a chair is not diagnostic of osteoarthritis, as it can be a symptom of many different conditions, including fibromyalgia, polymyalgic rheumatica, and other musculoskeletal disorders.

H. A history of diabetes is relevant, as it can increase the risk of developing certain musculoskeletal disorders, such as osteoarthritis and diabetic neuropathy.

I. Joint stiffness of over an hour suggests a muscular disorder, such as myositis or fibromyalgia, is not necessarily true, as joint stiffness can vary in duration and severity in different conditions.

Question: An 18-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 10 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to his chest. On arrival, he is unresponsive to painful stimuli. His pulse is 130/min, respirations are 8/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. The trachea is at the midline. Heart sounds are not audible. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options: A. Pericardiocentesis
B. Perform a CT scan of the chest
C. Thoracentesis
D. Bronchoscopy
E. Administer morphine for pain management
F. Echocardiography
G. Chest x-ray
H. Surgical exploration of the wound
I. Administer intravenous antibiotics
J. Administer oxygen therapy
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to the ABCDE approach in emergency medicine for help. The patient is unresponsive, has a low blood pressure, and has signs of shock (jugular venous distention). These symptoms suggest that the patient may have a pericardial tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform an echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and to guide further treatment. The answer is (F).

Pericardiocentesis, while it may be a treatment for pericardial tamponade, is not the most appropriate next step in management as it is an invasive procedure that should be performed only after a diagnosis has been confirmed. A CT scan of the chest may be useful for further imaging, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as it would take time to perform and the patient's condition is critical. Thoracentesis is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms suggest a problem with the heart, not the lungs. Bronchoscopy, morphine, antibiotics, and oxygen therapy are not appropriate as they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Surgical exploration of the wound may be necessary later, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the patient's condition is critical and further imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.",1425,310,8.689290761947632,2055.6299999952316

Question: A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-month history of leg weakness and dry eyes and mouth. He also has had a 10.4-kg (23-lb) weight loss over the past 4 months despite no change in appetite. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. Medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone. Examination shows mild ptosis. He has a barrelshaped chest. Breath sounds are distant. There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Reflexes are absent. He has difficulty rising from a chair. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on biochemistry for help. The statement that is correct about protein structure is:

A. Cross-links formed by reduction of -SH groups of cysteine to form disulphide bridges render the amino acid unavailable to digestion.

This is because disulphide bridges are formed by the oxidation of -SH groups of cysteine residues, not reduction. However, the formation of disulphide bridges does indeed make the protein more stable and resistant to digestion.

","A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence, and a deletion is the removal of one or more nucleotides from a DNA sequence. In this case, if the original DNA sequence experiences both a point mutation and a deletion, the resulting sequence would have one less nucleotide and one different nucleotide at the mutation site.

Let's examine each option:

* Option A: 5' - GGATCCTCA - 3' has one less nucleotide (T) and one different nucleotide (C instead of A) at the mutation site, so it is a possible answer.
* Option B: 5’ – TGATCCCAG – 3’ has a different sequence, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option C: 5’ – GGATCCATG – 3’ has one different nucleotide (A instead of T) at the mutation site, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option D: 5' - GGATCCTCGT - 3' has one more nucleotide (T) and one different nucleotide (T instead of C) at the mutation site, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option E: 5’ – GGTCCTCATC – 3’ has a different sequence, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option F: 5' - GGATCCGCATG - 3' has two different nucleotides (C instead of T and G instead of C) at the mutation site, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option G: 5' - GGATCTCATG - 3' has one different nucleotide (T instead of C) at the mutation site, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option H: 5' - GGATCCTCAT - 3' has one less nucleotide (T) and one different nucleotide (A instead of C) at the mutation site, so it is a possible answer.
* Option I: 5' - GGATCCTCAG - 3' has one different nucleotide (A instead of T) at the mutation site, so it is not the correct answer.
* Option J: 5’ – GCATCCTCATG – 3’ has a different sequence, so it is not the correct answer.

Both options A and H are possible answers, but option A has the correct sequence with one less nucleotide and one different nucleotide at the mutation site. Therefore, the answer is (A).",1365,583,16.180980682373047,3863.8650000095367

Question: Which of the following disorders does not show X-linked inheritance?
Options: A. Haemophilia A
B. Fragile X syndrome
C. Becker muscular dystrophy
D. Color blindness
E. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
F. Haemophilia B
G. Fabry disease
H. Tay-Sachs disease
I. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on genetics for help. X-linked inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which a trait is determined by a gene on the X chromosome. In humans, females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of each X-linked gene, one from each parent. Males, on the other hand, have only one X chromosome, so they only have one copy of each X-linked gene.

Let's go through the options:

* Haemophilia A and Haemophilia B are X-linked recessive disorders, meaning that males who inherit a mutated X chromosome from either their mother or father will have the disorder.
* Fragile X syndrome, Becker muscular dystrophy, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy are not X-linked disorders. They can be inherited in various ways, such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial inheritance.

Therefore, the disorder that does not show X-linked inheritance is (D) Color blindness. The answer is (D).",1227,288,8.049929141998291,1902.416000008583

Question: During a study of renal glomeruli, a healthy animal kidney is kept in a vascular bath preparation at a constant afferent arterial pressure of 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, which of the following Starling forces is most likely to change in the glomeruli?
Options: A. Increased filtration coefficient (Kf)
B. Increased hydrostatic pressure
C. Increased blood flow
D. Increased oncotic pressure
E. Decreased hydrostatic pressure
F. No change in Starling forces
G. Decreased oncotic pressure
H. Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf)
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on physiology for help. In a vascular bath preparation, the afferent arterial pressure is kept constant at 100 mm Hg. If the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, the resistance to blood flow increases, which causes a decrease in blood flow through the glomerulus. This decrease in blood flow leads to a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, which is one of the Starling forces. The other Starling force is the oncotic pressure, which is the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins in the capillaries. Since the oncotic pressure is not affected by the constriction of the efferent arteriole, the net filtration pressure (the difference between the hydrostatic pressure and the oncotic pressure) decreases. Therefore, the filtration coefficient (Kf) is likely to decrease as well. The answer is (H).",1293,213,5.99477219581604,1413.0200000405312

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We are looking for a rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects. The post hoc analysis showed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects, but the overall trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. This discrepancy could be due to a Type I error, which is a false positive result, or a Type II error, which is a false negative result. However, in this case, the overall trial showed no benefit, and the post hoc analysis showed a benefit among African American subjects. This suggests that the benefit among African American subjects may have been a false positive result, or Type I error. Therefore, the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of the efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects is (I) There was a Type I error.",1414,182,5.123676061630249,1213.6290000081062

Question: A 32-year-old man who is a jackhammer operator comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm for 3 days. The symptoms are moderately exacerbated by exertion. Examination of the right upper extremity shows erythema and moderate edema. Capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: A. Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis
B. Deep venous valvular insufficiency
C. Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein
D. Superior vena cava syndrome
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical conditions for help. The symptoms described in the question (pain and swelling of the right arm, erythema, moderate edema, and a capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds) are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis, which is an inflammation of a vein, usually caused by a blood clot. However, the question mentions that the patient is a jackhammer operator, and this occupation can increase the risk of developing superior vena cava syndrome, which is a blockage of the superior vena cava, a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the heart. Superior vena cava syndrome can cause similar symptoms to superficial thrombophlebitis, such as swelling of the face, neck, and arms. Therefore, it is possible that the most likely diagnosis is superior vena cava syndrome. However, it is important to note that this is a complex medical condition and a definitive diagnosis would require further testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional. The answer is (D) Superior vena cava syndrome.",1283,248,6.929206371307373,1631.8090000152588

I. Insufficient caloric intake
J. Overconsumption of caffeinated beverages
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Iodine is an essential nutrient that is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland requires iodine to make thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are essential for normal growth and development, especially in infants and children. Iodine deficiency can lead to a variety of health problems, including goiter, mental retardation, and cretinism.

The options that could lead to iodine deficiency are:

* Living at high altitudes (A) - Iodine is less available in the soil at high altitudes, which can lead to lower levels of iodine in the food chain.
* Intake only of locally grown food in central Africa (C) - Central Africa is a region where iodine deficiency is common due to low levels of iodine in the soil.
* Low intake of dairy products (D) - Dairy products are a good source of iodine.
* Inadequate sunlight exposure (H) - Iodine is produced by seaweed and can be absorbed by the skin when exposed to sunlight.

Therefore, the answer is (A), (C), (D), and (H).",1245,280,7.817911863327026,1831.9020000100136

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on statistics for help. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, the alpha level (also known as the significance level) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A lower alpha level increases the stringency of the test, making it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. In this case, if the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, the study will have more power, meaning it will be more likely to detect a statistically significant difference between the new drug and standard therapy if one truly exists.

Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?
Options: A. Deltoid
B. Infraspinatus
C. Supraspinatus
D. Triceps Brachii
E. Subscapularis
F. Coracobrachialis
G. Teres Major
H. Pectoralis

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. The teres minor is a muscle that helps rotate the arm outward (externally rotate the shoulder). The pain reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance suggests that the teres minor is involved. However, the pain may also be caused by inflammation of the infraspinatus tendon, which is located in the same area and also helps with external rotation of the shoulder. Therefore, it is possible that both the teres minor and the infraspinatus tendon are affected. However, since the question asks for the most likely inflamed tendon, we can consider the symptoms and the location of the pain. The infraspinatus tendon is located deeper in the shoulder and is more likely to be affected by repetitive movements such as chopping wood. Therefore, the most likely inflamed tendon in this patient is the infraspinatus tendon. The answer is (B).",1307,212,5.980879545211792,1414.4629999995232

Question: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options: A. CT scan of the abdomen
B. CT scan of the chest
C. Bronchoscopy
D. Bone marrow aspiration
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can start by considering the patient's symptoms (easy bruising) and her medical history (lung cancer treated with radiation therapy, hypertension, and medication history). The patient's low platelet count (35,000/mm3) is also a significant finding.

Given the patient's history of radiation therapy, it is possible that she has developed radiation-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in platelet count as a side effect of radiation therapy. However, it is also important to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, such as autoimmune disorders, infections, or drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

A serum antiplatelet antibody assay was negative, which helps to rule out drug-induced thrombocytopenia. However, it is still important to perform further diagnostic tests to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer, a CT scan of the chest would be a reasonable next step to rule out metastatic disease or other complications related to her lung cancer. A bone marrow aspiration may also be considered to evaluate the bone marrow for evidence of aplastic anemia or other causes of thrombocytopenia.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be a CT scan of the chest. The answer is (B).",1343,317,8.899702787399292,2108.6409999728203

Question: A 31-year-old man with a 5-year history of HIV infection comes to the office because of anal pain, particularly on defecation, for the past 4 months. He says he has seen spots of blood on the toilet tissue but has not had any other noticeable bleeding. He reports no change in bowel habits and has not had recent fever, chills, or rectal drainage. He says he and his partner engage in anal-receptive intercourse. His most recent CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 2 months ago was 350/mm3 ; HIV viral load at that time was undetectable. He currently is being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He has had no opportunistic infections. Medical history is also significant for syphilis and genital herpes treated with penicillin and acyclovir, respectively. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes, but respiratory, cardiac, and abdominal examinations disclose no abnormalities. There are several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area. Rectal examination produces tenderness, but there is no rectal discharge. Test of the stool for occult blood is trace positive.

Options: A. Acyclovir
B. Imiquimod
C. Levofloxacin
D. Metronidazole
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on HIV and related infections for help.

Question: A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness.

Options: A. Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D. The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E. The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on genetics and cystic fibrosis for help. The G551D mutation in the CFTR gene is a common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). In autosomal recessive disorders like CF, a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. However, in some cases, a person with only one mutated copy of the CFTR gene may have milder symptoms, known as a carrier state. In this case, the patient has a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene, which suggests that she is a carrier of the CFTR mutation. The symptoms she is experiencing, such as abdominal pain, thick nasal secretions, and a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis, are consistent with the clinical phenotype of cystic fibrosis. However, since she only has one mutated copy of the CFTR gene, it is likely that her symptoms are not as severe as they would be if she had two mutated copies.

","We can use the formula for calculating the yield of ATP from the complete oxidation of glucose, which is 38 ATP molecules. However, since the question asks for the yield in terms of the number of ATP molecules from the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, we need to subtract the ATP molecules that are used in the process of glycolysis.

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on orthopedics for help. The symptoms described in the question suggest a foot drop on the right, which is a weakness or inability to lift the front part of the foot, and a lack of fluid motion in the gait. The standing flexion test results are negative, and the cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. These symptoms are consistent with a lesion in the lower part of the leg, specifically the peroneal nerve, which can cause foot drop. The peroneal nerve runs down the back of the knee and branches off to the lower leg and foot. One of the common causes of peroneal nerve injury is a direct blow to the knee, which is what the patient experienced while playing football. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a peroneal nerve injury. The answer is (G) posteriorly deviated fibular head, as this condition can cause peroneal nerve injury. However, it's important to note that a thorough clinical examination and diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",1302,219,6.155552625656128,1438.576000034809

Question: A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22– 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?
Options: A. The patient is not a carrier of the DMD as her muscle creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range
B. The patient's mother is a carrier, hence the patient is definitely a carrier too
C. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD
D. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives.
E. The patient has a 25% risk of having a child with DMD
F. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration
G. The patient's DMD carrier status is certain due to maternal transmission
H. The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD
I. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation
J. The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We know that Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that females who carry the mutated gene are carriers but usually do not show symptoms. The disease is caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene, which is located on the X chromosome.

The patient's family history shows that her brother and maternal uncle had DMD and died at young ages. This suggests that the patient's mother is a carrier of the mutated dystrophin gene. However, since genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death, we cannot be certain of their exact genetic status.

The patient's serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L, which is within the normal range. However, this does not necessarily mean that the patient is not a carrier of the DMD gene. Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in muscle tissue, and elevated levels of CK can indicate muscle damage. The patient's mother has an elevated CK concentration of 300 U/L, which may suggest that she is a carrier of the DMD gene.

Given the family history and the mother's elevated CK concentration, it is likely that the patient is a carrier of the DMD gene. However, without genetic testing, we cannot be certain. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives. The answer is (D).

It is important to note that if the patient decides to have children, she has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to her offspring, which could result in the child having DMD. Genetic counseling is important for individuals who have a family history of genetic disorders to understand their risk and options for prenatal testing and family planning.",1500,412,11.45689868927002,2731.0060000419617

D. The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed
E. The release of glucagon after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach
F. The stomach decreases its ""tone"" at the end of a meal to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus
G. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility
H. The release of insulin after eating a meal will speed up the emptying of the stomach

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy and physiology for help. Intestinal motility is a complex process, orchestrated by nerves, hormones, and the presence of food in the stomach. The correct statement about this process is that at the start of a meal, the stomach increases its ""tone"" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus. The answer is (A).

The migrating motor complex (MMC) is responsible for the peristaltic movement of the intestines between meals, and it is not chiefly responsible for the absorption of nutrients or the emptying of the stomach. The MMC is also responsible for the cleaning of the intestines, which is known as the interdigestive phase. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum can either speed up or slow down intestinal motility, depending on the specific type of fat and starch and the individual's digestive system. The release of glucagon and insulin after eating a meal can affect the emptying of the stomach, but they do not directly speed up or slow down intestinal motility. The presence of partially digested protein and fiber in the duodenum can also affect intestinal motility, but the specific effect can vary.",1415,286,8.023239135742188,1897.925000011921

Question: Sauna use, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body's core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F)…  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors… The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]

The review article sources a lot of data from Finland population studies, where the incidence of sauna use is substantially higher than most countries. Using the data, which of the following is something that is more plausible in Finland than elsewhere?
Options: A. Lower rates of cardiovascular-related deaths among frequent sauna users.
B. More gold medals in adolescent skiing.
C. A higher percentage of the population with optimized body's response to heat.
D. Higher incidence of sauna-related injuries.
E. Increased prevalence of heat tolerance in the population.
F. Decreased rates of psychotic disorders among frequent sauna users.

Question: Which of the following is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance?
Options: A. Transmitted by females only to males
B. Transmitted by males only to females
C. Female to female transmission
D. No male to male or female to female transmission
E. Male to male transmission
F. Parental consanguinity
G. Male to female transmission, but not female to male
H. Transmission only by males
I. Both parents must carry the gene
J. Transmission only by females
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on genetics for help. X-linked dominant inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which a trait is determined by a gene on the X chromosome. In this pattern, a mutation in a single copy of the gene (either the mother's or the father's) is enough to cause the trait to be expressed in the offspring. In X-linked dominant inheritance, both males and females can transmit the trait to their offspring. However, males have only one X chromosome, so they will always express the trait if they inherit the mutated gene. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they may or may not express the trait depending on whether they inherit the mutated gene from one or both parents. Therefore, the feature of X-linked dominant inheritance is that it can be transmitted by both males and females, but males will always express the trait if they inherit the mutated gene.

Question: A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?
Options: A. Metaphase
B. G1
C. Prophase

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We know that the p53 protein plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1 phase, where it can arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. The mutation in the p53 gene leading to an inactive gene product would result in a loss of this function, allowing cells with DNA damage to continue dividing. Therefore, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.

Question: A 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours. The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options: A. Obtain echocardiography
B. Administer oral antibiotics
C. Provide intravenous fluids and observe
D. Order a chest X-ray
E. Initiate seizure precautions
F. Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management
G. Wait for the patient's consent for a lumbar puncture
H. Obtain CT scan of the head
I. Administer intravenous antibiotics
J. Perform a psychiatric evaluation
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to the given scenario and the question, which is asking for the most appropriate next step in the given situation. The patient is a 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation who is lethargic, has a fever, decreased muscle tone, and an elevated white blood cell count with a high percentage of band neutrophils. The patient refuses a lumbar puncture, and the caregiver cannot be reached. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the urine toxicology screen is negative.

Given these symptoms, it is important to consider the possibility of a bacterial infection, such as meningitis or sepsis. However, the patient's refusal of a lumbar puncture makes it difficult to definitively diagnose these conditions.

In this situation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a CT scan of the head to rule out any acute intracranial processes, such as an abscess or mass, that could be causing the patient's symptoms. This would help to guide further management and determine if additional diagnostic tests, such as a lumbar puncture, are necessary.

Therefore, the answer is (H) Obtain CT scan of the head.",1543,270,7.586040496826172,1812.6850000023842

Question: A 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours. The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options: A. Obtain echocardiography
B. Administer oral antibiotics
C. Provide intravenous fluids and observe
D. Order a chest X-ray
E. Initiate seizure precautions
F. Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management
G. Wait for the patient's consent for a lumbar puncture
H. Obtain CT scan of the head
I. Administer intravenous antibiotics
J. Perform a psychiatric evaluation
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to the given scenario and the question, which is asking for the most appropriate next step in the given situation. The patient is a 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation who is lethargic, has a fever, decreased muscle tone, and an elevated white blood cell count with a high percentage of band neutrophils. The patient refuses a lumbar puncture, and the caregiver cannot be reached. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the urine toxicology screen is negative.

Given these symptoms, it is important to consider the possibility of a bacterial infection, such as meningitis or sepsis. However, the patient's refusal of a lumbar puncture makes it difficult to definitively diagnose these conditions.

In this situation, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a CT scan of the head to rule out any acute intracranial processes, such as an abscess or mass, that could be causing the patient's symptoms. This would help to guide further management and determine if additional diagnostic tests, such as a lumbar puncture, are necessary.

Therefore, the answer is (H) Obtain CT scan of the head.",1543,270,7.570105314254761,1790.2229999899864

Question: A 40-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia is transferred to the emergency department from the residential facility where he lives 2 hours after having swallowed a nail. The patient says he does not have any symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His only current medication is haloperidol. The patient is not in acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination discloses a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts. X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant. No free air is visible. After admitting the patient to the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate management?
Options: A. Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision
B. Insertion of a nasogastric tube to suction out the nail
C. Administration of activated charcoal to bind the nail and facilitate its removal
D. Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy
E. Administration of a barium swallow to track the nail's passage
F. Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail
G. Administering a laxative to expedite the passage of the nail
H. Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis
I. Use of a magnet to draw out the nail
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on emergency medicine for help. The most appropriate management for a 40-year-old man with paranoid schizophrenia who has swallowed a nail and is not in acute distress, with normal vital signs and physical examination, would be observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis. This is because the nail is not causing any immediate harm and the patient is not in acute distress. The answer is (H).

It's important to note that if the nail were causing symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or perforation, more aggressive management such as endoscopic removal or surgery would be necessary. Additionally, if the patient were to develop symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, or vomiting, further evaluation and management would be required.

It's also worth mentioning that the other options listed, such as administration of activated charcoal, ipecac, or a laxative, are not appropriate for the management of a swallowed foreign body in this case. A nasogastric tube would not be effective in removing a nail, and endoscopic removal would not be necessary in the absence of symptoms. A magnet would not be effective in removing a metal object such as a nail, and a barium swallow would not be useful in this case as it is used to visualize the gastrointestinal tract, not to remove foreign bodies.",1453,300,8.392211675643921,1996.9549999833107

E. They can infect multiple species
F. They don't require a host to survive
G. Can integrate into host chromosomes
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid. The answer is (B).

Question: A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40 pack-year history, and consumes more than 8 cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467 U/L (reference range: 28-100 U/L) and a γ-glutamyltransferase level of 212 U/L (reference range: < 55 U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?
Options: A. anterior rami of C1-C5
B. anterior rami of T11-T12
C. anterior rami of L1-L5
D. posterior rami of T6-T10
E. posterior rami of L1-L5
F. posterior rami of T11-T12
G. anterior rami of T6-T10
H. anterior rami of T1-T5
I. anterior rami of C6-C10
J. posterior rami of T1-T5
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. The epigastric region is innervated by the anterior rami of T7 to T10. However, the pain may be referred to other areas due to the complex nature of the somatic nervous system. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with pancreatitis, which is a condition that can cause referred pain to the back. The posterior rami of T11-T12 also innervate the back, so it is possible that the pain is being referred to this area. However, the most likely answer is that the pain is being referred to the anterior rami of T11-T12, as this is the most direct pathway from the pancreas to the back. The answer is (F).",1447,172,4.859396696090698,1136.9129999876022

Question: A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options: A. Skeletal survey
B. Echocardiography
C. Bone scan
D. MRI of the shoulder
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can start by considering the symptoms presented by the 5-year-old girl, which include recurrent injuries, clumsiness, chest pain with exertion, pain or swelling of the knees or ankles after practice, and a limp. Additionally, the patient's family history of joint injuries and aortic aneurysm, her height and weight percentiles, and the physical examination findings of a midsystolic click at the apex, swollen and tender left ankle, hypermobile joints, and 25 degrees of genu recurvatum are also important.

Given these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient has a connective tissue disorder, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These disorders are characterized by joint hypermobility, tall stature, and a predisposition to joint and cardiovascular complications.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform an echocardiography to evaluate for cardiovascular complications, such as aortic root dilation or aortic dissection, which are common in Marfan syndrome.

The answer is (B) Echocardiography.",1457,260,7.291844367980957,1729.9780000448227

I. Calcium intake is not important for older people.
J. There is strong evidence that vitamin C supplements lower the risk of cancer in older people.
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on geriatrics for help. The nutritional status of older people is a complex issue. While it is true that some older people may require dietary supplementation to maintain nutritional status, it is not accurate to say that consuming multivitamins can eliminate all nutritional deficiencies in older people. High protein diets can be beneficial for older people, as long as they are balanced and do not exceed recommended daily intake. Older people are not more prone to Vitamin A overdose, and the risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people. Older people should consume adequate amounts of calcium to maintain bone health. Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 is a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older people. There is some evidence that vitamin C supplements may lower the risk of certain types of cancer, but the evidence is not conclusive. The statement that all older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status is not accurate, as vitamin D status can vary widely among individuals. The statement that older people should consume more sodium to maintain their health is not accurate, as high sodium intake can increase the risk of high blood pressure and other health problems.

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid. The answer is (B).

Question: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?
Options: A. Hematoma of the left thigh
B. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
C. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization
D. Side effect of prolonged bed rest
E. Peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes
F. Spinal cord injury during IVC filter placement
G. Sciatic nerve damage during hospitalization
H. Adverse reaction to warfarin
I. Complication of the IVC filter placement
J. Deep vein thrombosis in the left leg
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to the given case and the symptoms described: a 67-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and IVC filter placement, who is currently on warfarin, presents with a persistent tingling and numbness of her left thigh that started after discharge from the hospital. The examination shows decreased sensation over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh.

The most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), which is a peripheral nerve that supplies sensation to the skin on the anterolateral thigh. This nerve can be compressed by various factors, such as prolonged bed rest, surgery, or hematoma. In this case, the patient had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital, and the location of the numbness corresponds to the area supplied by the LFCN. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The answer is (B).",1486,254,7.109973669052124,1678.9560000300407

Question: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?
Options: A. Median nerve at the forearm
B. Radial nerve at the forearm
C. Ulnar nerve at the elbow
D. Median nerve at the elbow
E. Radial nerve at the wrist
F. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm
G. Radial nerve at the elbow
H. Ulnar nerve at the wrist
I. Median nerve at the wrist
J. Musculocutaneous nerve at the wrist
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy and neurology for help. The median nerve is responsible for sensation in the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the radial half of the ring finger. It also provides motor function to the thenar muscles. The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger, and it also provides motor function to the hypothenar muscles and the muscles of the hand. The median nerve is susceptible to compression at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) and at the elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome). However, the symptoms described in the question (numbness in the right hand, tingling in the right ring and small fingers, and pain upon palpation of the right elbow) are more consistent with compression of the median nerve at the elbow. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the median nerve at the elbow. The answer is (D).",1422,202,5.694486856460571,1341.4490000009537

Question: In a cohort study of elderly women, the relative risk ratio for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly is 1.2 (95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture?
Options: A. Statistically significant overall increase in risk
B. Statistically insignificant change in risk for those who exercise regularly
C. Statistically significant overall decrease in risk
D. Statistically nonsignificant decrease in risk
E. Statistically significant decrease in risk only for those over 80
F. Statistically significant overall decrease in risk for those who exercise regularly
G. Statistically nonsignificant overall decrease in risk
H. Statistically significant increase in risk only for those under 70
I. No statistically significant change in risk
J. Statistically nonsignificant increase in risk
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the 95% confidence interval to determine if the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture is statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval (1.1 to 1.8) does not include the value of 1, which represents no effect. This means that the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture is statistically significant.

The relative risk ratio of 1.2 indicates a 20% increase in the risk for hip fracture among those who exercise regularly. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture is that there is a statistically significant overall increase in risk. The answer is (A).",1333,151,4.2653727531433105,1009.3280000090599

Question: A 33-year-old man undergoes a radical thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?
Options: A. Branch of the costocervical trunk
B. Branch of the external carotid artery
C. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk
D. Tributary of the internal jugular vein
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy and endocrinology for help. The parathyroid glands are four small glands located in the neck, near the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps regulate the level of calcium in the blood. During a radical thyroidectomy, the parathyroid glands are at risk of being damaged or removed, which can lead to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels in the blood). The symptoms of hypocalcemia include muscle cramps, numbness, and tingling sensations.

In this case, the patient has a low calcium level (7.5 mg/dL) and a high PTH level (200 pg/mL), which are indicative of hypocalcemia. The parathyroid glands are stimulated to produce more PTH in an attempt to raise the calcium level in the blood. The low albumin level (4 g/dL) is likely due to the patient's dehydration as a result of the surgery and hemorrhaging.

The thyrocervical trunk is a branch of the subclavian artery that supplies blood to the neck and shoulder. It gives rise to the thyroid artery, which provides blood to the thyroid gland and the parathyroid glands. Damage to the thyrocervical trunk during the operation could have caused the findings in this patient. The answer is (C) Branch of the thyrocervical trunk.",1293,338,9.425256729125977,2202.770999968052

Question: A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?
Options: A. oral protein-rich diet
B. feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube
C. feeding through a jejunostomy tube
D. central hyperalimentation
E. intravenous saline solution
F. peripheral hyperalimentation
G. oral carbohydrate-rich diet
H. feeding through a gastrostomy tube
I. oral fat-free modular diet
J. intravenous dextrose solution
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The patient has been unable to eat for 6 days after surgery, which suggests that she may not be able to tolerate oral feeding. Additionally, she has a protracted ileus, which is a condition characterized by the abnormal, prolonged, or repeated contraction of the ileum, a part of the small intestine. This condition can make it difficult for the patient to digest food.

Given these circumstances, the most appropriate form of nutritional support for this patient would be feeding through a jejunostomy tube. A jejunostomy tube is a tube that is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the jejunum, a part of the small intestine. This allows the patient to receive nutrients directly into the small intestine, bypassing the ileus. The answer is (C).

Option (D) central hyperalimentation refers to the administration of nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a central venous catheter. This method is typically used for patients who are unable to eat or absorb nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract for an extended period of time, but it is more invasive and carries a higher risk of complications than a jejunostomy tube.

Option (B) feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube is not appropriate in this case because the patient has a protracted ileus, which makes it difficult for the stomach to empty properly. This can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia if the patient is fed through a nasogastric tube.

Option (A) oral protein-rich diet is not appropriate because the patient is unable to eat.

Option (E) intravenous saline solution is not appropriate because it does not provide the necessary nutrients that the patient needs to recover.

Option (F) peripheral hyperalimentation refers to the administration of nutrients into a peripheral vein, which is not appropriate for this patient because it is less effective than central hyperalimentation and can lead to complications such as phlebitis and inadequate nutrient delivery.

Question: Why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?
Options: A. They are able to alter the host's DNA
B. Because they have no nucleic acid
C. They can survive in extreme temperatures
D. Only replicate in dividing cells
E. They can infect multiple species
F. They don't require a host to survive
G. Can integrate into host chromosomes
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid. The answer is (B).

Question: A 35-year-old female develops nausea and vomiting after she underwent a cholecystectomy for protracted ileus. Her body mass index was 23 kg/m2 before surgery, and, except for the cholecystitis, she was in good health. The patient remains unable to eat 6 days after surgery. Which of the following forms of nutritional support is most appropriate for this patient?
Options: A. oral protein-rich diet
B. feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube
C. feeding through a jejunostomy tube
D. central hyperalimentation
E. intravenous saline solution
F. peripheral hyperalimentation
G. oral carbohydrate-rich diet
H. feeding through a gastrostomy tube
I. oral fat-free modular diet
J. intravenous dextrose solution
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The patient has been unable to eat for 6 days after surgery, which suggests that she may not be able to tolerate oral feeding. Additionally, she has a protracted ileus, which is a condition characterized by the abnormal, prolonged, or repeated contraction of the ileum, a part of the small intestine. This condition can make it difficult for the patient to digest food.

Given these circumstances, the most appropriate form of nutritional support for this patient would be feeding through a jejunostomy tube. A jejunostomy tube is a tube that is inserted through the abdominal wall and into the jejunum, a part of the small intestine. This allows the patient to receive nutrients directly into the small intestine, bypassing the ileus. The answer is (C).

Option (D) central hyperalimentation refers to the administration of nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a central venous catheter. This method is typically used for patients who are unable to eat or absorb nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract for an extended period of time, but it is more invasive and carries a higher risk of complications than a jejunostomy tube.

Option (B) feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube is not appropriate in this case because the patient has a protracted ileus, which makes it difficult for the stomach to empty properly. This can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia if the patient is fed through a nasogastric tube.

Option (A) oral protein-rich diet is not appropriate because the patient is unable to eat.

Option (E) intravenous saline solution is not appropriate because it does not provide the necessary nutrients that the patient needs to recover.

Option (F) peripheral hyperalimentation refers to the administration of nutrients into a peripheral vein, which is not appropriate for this patient because it is less effective than central hyperalimentation and can lead to complications such as phlebitis and inadequate nutrient delivery.

Option (G) oral carbohydrate-rich diet is not appropriate because the patient is unable to eat.

Option (H) feeding through a gastrostomy tube is not appropriate because it is not the most appropriate method for this patient given her protracted ileus.

Option (I) oral fat-free modular diet is not appropriate because the patient needs a balanced diet to recover, not just carbohydrates.

Option (J) intravenous dextrose solution is not appropriate because it does not provide the necessary nutrients that the patient needs to recover.",1335,598,16.567447185516357,3934.2329999804497

Question: A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher’s observation?
Options: A. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.
B. The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
C. The students were more excited about the quizzes than about the reward system.
D. The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-interval schedule than it was to a fixed-ratio schedule.
E. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.
F. The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
G. The students' behavior change was weaker in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
H. The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-interval schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
I. The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a continuous reinforcement schedule than it was to a variable-ratio schedule.
J. The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the principles of operant conditioning to explain the teacher's observation. In this case, the teacher is using a variable-ratio reinforcement schedule (VR) for the quizzes and a continuous reinforcement schedule (CR) for attendance.

In a VR schedule, reinforcement is given after a certain number of responses, but the number of responses between reinforcements varies. In this case, the reinforcement (a sticker) is given to students who get above a 90% on three quizzes in a row, but the number of quizzes between reinforcements varies.

In a CR schedule, reinforcement is given every time a response is made. In this case, the reinforcement (a sticker) is given to students who show up on time every day.

According to the principles of operant conditioning, VR schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction. This is because the unpredictable reinforcement creates a sense of anticipation and excitement, which can lead to stronger and more persistent behavior.

In contrast, CR schedules tend to produce weaker and more easily extinguished behavior because the reinforcement is predictable and less rewarding.

Therefore, the teacher's observation that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly can be explained by the fact that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to the VR schedule for the quizzes than it was to the CR schedule for attendance.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who has lost weight and has a decreased appetite, nausea, and no depression. These symptoms are indicative of malnutrition, which can be caused by various factors such as chronic illness, medication side effects, or dental problems. However, the patient's history of congestive heart failure and current medications (furosemide and digoxin) suggest that the weight loss may be related to fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study would be renal function tests (F) to assess the patient's kidney function and check for any signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. This is because renal function tests can help determine if the patient's kidneys are functioning properly and if they are able to excrete waste products and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Additionally, the patient's weight loss and decreased appetite may be related to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can be assessed through renal function tests.",1415,236,6.629757642745972,1554.8009999990463

Question: A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-week history of low-grade fever and increasing abdominal cramps that are exacerbated by bowel movements. She began a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole 2 days ago but has had no relief of her symptoms. She has had intermittent constipation for the past 12 years. She has not had nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools. She has a 3-year history of hypertension. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago because of leiomyomata uteri. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 280,000/mm3 ; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities.

Options: A. Test of the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin
B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
C. Pelvic ultrasonography
D. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","Given the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, it is likely that she has appendicitis. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be an imaging study of the abdomen, such as a CT scan with contrast (D). This would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Pelvic ultrasonography (C) may be useful in ruling out other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as ovarian cysts, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (B) is a procedure used to diagnose and treat problems with the bile and pancreatic ducts, and it is not indicated in this case.

Testing the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin (A) is not appropriate in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a C. difficile infection.

The answer is (D) CT scan of the abdomen with contrast.",1589,228,6.415070056915283,1526.2060000300407

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on emergency medicine and cardiology for help. The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is a type of heart attack. The patient's chest pain, shortness of breath, and ECG findings are indicative of this condition. The patient's blood pressure is also high, which is a risk factor for ACS.

The most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time is a nitrate, such as nitroglycerin, to help dilate the blood vessels and reduce the workload on the heart. Other options such as verapamil, furosemide, phentolamine, carvedilol, metoprolol, lisinopril, and warfarin may be considered in certain situations, but nitrates are the first-line treatment for ACS. Therefore, the answer is (A) Nitroprusside. However, it's important to note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored and further treatment may be necessary based on the patient's response to therapy.",1578,257,7.218081474304199,1715.3930000066757

Question: A 52-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea and cough productive of tenacious, brownishyellow sputum for the past 3 weeks. He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?
Options: A. Lung transplantation
B. Continuous humidified oxygen
C. Daily chest physiotherapy
D. Pulmonary rehabilitation
E. Azathioprine therapy
F. Bronchoscopy
G. Corticosteroid therapy
H. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on pulmonology and radiology for help. The patient's symptoms, history of sandblasting, smoking, and chest x-ray findings suggest a diagnosis of silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of silica dust. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes, which are characteristic of silicosis.

The most appropriate intervention for this patient would be to provide continuous humidified oxygen to help with the hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and to manage the symptoms of dyspnea (shortness of breath). The answer is (B) Continuous humidified oxygen.

Additionally, the patient may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation to help improve their lung function and quality of life. The answer is (D) Pulmonary rehabilitation.

It's also important to note that the patient's smoking history should be addressed, as smoking can exacerbate the symptoms of silicosis and increase the risk of other lung diseases. The patient should be encouraged to quit smoking.

Lastly, the patient's clubbed fingers and muffled heart sounds suggest possible right heart failure, which may be a complication of silicosis. The patient should be monitored for signs of right heart failure and treated accordingly.

In summary, the most appropriate interventions for this patient would be to provide continuous humidified oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation, and to address the patient's smoking history. The answer is (B) Continuous humidified oxygen and (D) Pulmonary rehabilitation.",1525,383,10.678889036178589,2542.9529999494553

Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?
Options: A. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B. Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C. Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D. Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E. Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F. Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G. Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H. Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I. Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J. Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","The relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X is calculated by dividing the rate of the event in the treatment group by the rate of the event in the control group. In this case, the rate of death from the specific type of cancer in the treatment group (200/100 = 2) is twice the rate of death in the control group (400/100 = 4). Therefore, the relative risk is 2/4 = 0.5, which means that individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to individuals who do not take Drug X. The answer is (F).",1502,155,4.378499507904053,1043.180999994278

Question: Five years after being shot in the right thigh, a 21-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar. At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: A. Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery
B. Venous ulcer
C. Superficial venous thrombosis
D. Arteriovenous fistula
E. Lymphedema
F. Chronic venous insufficiency
G. Arterial spasm
H. Pulmonary embolism
I. Deep venous thrombosis
J. Peripheral artery disease
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on medical conditions for help. The symptoms described in the question (buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur, a thrill, dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg) are indicative of a venous condition. The presence of a thrill and a loud murmur suggest the presence of a turbulent blood flow, which is consistent with an arteriovenous fistula (a direct communication between an artery and a vein). However, the question mentions that the patient has varicose veins, which are veins that have become enlarged and twisted, and this is not typically associated with arteriovenous fistulas.

The question also mentions that the patient has been shot in the right thigh, and the symptoms described are consistent with a complication of a previous injury, such as a venous ulcer or chronic venous insufficiency. However, the presence of a thrill and a loud murmur are not typically associated with these conditions.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a complication of the previous injury, such as a venous ulcer or chronic venous insufficiency, but with the additional finding of a thrill and a loud murmur, it is possible that there is also an arteriovenous fistula present. To confirm the diagnosis, further diagnostic tests such as ultrasound or angiography would be needed.

Question: Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?

Options: A. The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides

C. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
D. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on digestion for help. The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. The statement (A) is the most correct.

Gastric digestion of all proteins is not equally efficient because of the different enzymes that are produced and secreted by different cells in the stomach. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete pepsin, which initiates the process of protein digestion. The statement (C) is partially correct, but it does not mention the other enzymes that are involved in protein digestion.

The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are absorbed by different amino acid transporters. The statement (D) is not correct because there are more than 14 different amino acid transporters.

The statement (B) is not correct because the grinding action of the antrum is not sufficient to digest proteins efficiently. The statement (B) is more applicable to the mechanical breakdown of food in the stomach.

Therefore, the answer is (A).",1285,252,7.071299076080322,1656.7780000567436

Question: A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been ""squatters"" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?
Options: A. Call her previous physician to obtain more history
B. Order a chest x-ray
C. Order a test for HIV antibody
D. Repeat the PPD skin test
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on dermatology and infectious diseases for help. The 3-year-old girl's positive PPD skin test result suggests that she may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB).

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options: A. Core needle biopsy of the right breast
B. Ductography
C. Start on antifungal treatment
D. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue
E. MRI of the right breast

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The patient's symptoms of black discharge from the nipple and glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast suggest a possible breast abscess or ductal ectasia. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a fine needle aspiration of the right nipple discharge (F) to obtain a sample of the discharge for analysis. This can help to determine the cause of the discharge and guide further treatment.

It's important to note that this is a general answer and the specific diagnosis and treatment plan should be determined by a healthcare professional based on a thorough examination and evaluation of the patient.

Question: A race car attempting to jump a series of 8 buses is set up on a flat track with a ramp at the end. Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?
Options: A. 26 m/s^2
B. 22 m/s^2
C. 10 m/s^2
D. 20 m/s^2
E. 17 m/s^2
F. 15 m/s^2
G. 7 m/s^2
H. 13 m/s^2
I. 18 m/s^2
J. 30 m/s^2
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the equation of motion to solve this problem:

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance.

In this case, we are given that v = 130 km/h, s = 50m, and v = 0 at the start (since the car is stationary).

First, we need to convert the velocity from km/h to m/s:

130 km/h = 130 \* 1000 m/3600 s = 36 m/s

Now, we can rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration:

a = (v^2 - u^2) / 2s

Since u = 0, we have:

a = v^2 / 2s

Substituting the values we have:

a = (36^2) / (2 \* 50) = 36^2 / 100 = 1296 / 100 = 12.96 m/s^2

The answer is (D) 20 m/s^2, since 20 m/s^2 is the closest multiple of 10 to the calculated value of 12.96 m/s^2. However, it's important to note that the actual acceleration required would be 12.96 m/s^2, not 20 m/s^2.",1328,358,10.06374192237854,2335.217999994755

Question: If the frequency of males affected with an X-linked recessive condition in a human population is .10 (one in ten), what will be the expected frequency of affected females?
Options: A. 0.001
B. 0.01
C. 0.1
D. 0.15
E. 0.0011
F. 0.02
G. 0.0001
H. 0.0002
I. 0.05
J. 0.2
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We know that X-linked recessive conditions affect males more severely because they have only one X chromosome, while females have two. In a population where the frequency of affected males is .10, the frequency of affected females would be much lower because females have a lower chance of inheriting the affected X chromosome from both parents.

Let's calculate the expected frequency of affected females:

1. The frequency of affected males is .10, so the frequency of unaffected males is 1 - .10 = .90 (nine out of ten).
2. Since females have two X chromosomes, the frequency of unaffected females is (.90)^2 = .81 (eighty-one out of a hundred).
3. The frequency of affected females is 1 - .81 = .19 (nineteen out of a hundred).

D. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
E. Spinal muscular atrophy
F. Hemophilia A
G. Oculocutaneous albinism
H. Fragile X syndrome
I. Cystic fibrosis
J. Tay-Sachs disease
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on genetics for help. Population carrier screening is a type of genetic testing that is offered to individuals in a specific population to identify carriers of certain genetic conditions. The goal of population carrier screening is to identify individuals who carry a genetic mutation that could potentially lead to a genetic disorder in their offspring.

Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. It is not suitable for population carrier screening because it is caused by a dominant mutation, meaning that if an individual inherits the mutation from one parent, they will develop the disease. In contrast, the other options listed (Thalassemia, Sickle cell disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Spinal muscular atrophy, Cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are recessive disorders, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. Therefore, population carrier screening is not appropriate for Huntington's disease. The answer is (B).

Question: A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?
Options: A. Increased glucose uptake by the brain
B. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal
C. Increased glucose uptake by red blood cells
D. Glucose release from skeletal muscle
E. Glycogenolysis in the liver
F. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues
G. Enhanced gluconeogenesis in the kidney
H. Elevated insulin secretion from the pancreas
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on physiology for help. The man's serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range after 12 hours, which suggests that his body is maintaining a stable blood glucose level. This is likely due to the storage of excess glucose as glycogen in the liver (E) and the suppression of glucose release from the liver (Elevated insulin secretion from the pancreas, H, would also contribute to this, but it is not the most likely mechanism in this case as the man is not consuming any additional food or drink during the 12-hour period). The other options do not explain the maintenance of stable blood glucose levels over a prolonged period without additional food or drink. The answer is (E).",1369,171,4.83055853843689,1147.2240000367165

Question: A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: A. Migraine with aura
B. Bacterial meningitis
C. Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis
D. Herpes simplex encephalitis
E. Influenza encephalopathy
F. Dextromethorphan intoxication
G. Viral meningitis
H. HIV encephalopathy
I. Lyme disease

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the given symptoms and lab results to narrow down the possible diagnoses. The patient has a fever, headache, confusion, short-term memory deficits, difficulty naming objects, and paraphasic errors.

The symptoms and MRI findings suggest a central nervous system (CNS) infection. The high erythrocyte count and high percentage of monocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid suggest a possible inflammatory process, such as meningitis. However, the low leukocyte count is unusual for bacterial meningitis, which typically has a higher leukocyte count.

The patient's history of a cough and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan suggests a possible viral infection. The low protein concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid is also more consistent with viral meningitis rather than bacterial meningitis.

Question: A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. The patient is unconcerned about the lack of menses. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses had occurred at regular 28-day intervals until they became irregular 1 year ago. She is a member of her high school gymnastics team. She appears emaciated. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 40 kg (88 lb); BMI is 15 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 54/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea?
Options: A. Polycystic ovarian syndrome
B. Prolactinoma
C. Cushing's syndrome
D. Premature ovarian failure
E. Hyperthyroidism
F. Pregnancy
G. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
H. Hypothyroidism
I. Turner syndrome
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the given information to make an educated guess about the most likely cause of the patient's amenorrhea. The patient is emaciated, with a low BMI, and is a member of a gymnastics team, which suggests that she may be underweight due to excessive exercise and/or poor nutrition. This is a common cause of amenorrhea in adolescent girls.

The patient's pulse and blood pressure are also low, which could be a sign of dehydration or poor cardiovascular function, both of which can be caused by malnutrition.

The patient's menstrual history suggests that her periods were regular until they became irregular a year ago, which is not typical of conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, prolactinoma, Cushing's syndrome, or hyperthyroidism.

Turner syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the ovaries, is a possibility, but the patient's height and weight are not consistent with the typical features of Turner syndrome.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition characterized by low levels of gonadotropins and sex hormones, is a possibility, but it is not clear from the information provided whether the patient has other symptoms that are associated with this condition.

Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's amenorrhea is malnutrition due to excessive exercise and/or poor nutrition. The answer is (G) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but it is important to note that further testing would be needed to confirm this diagnosis.",1395,363,10.136989116668701,2378.25100004673

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on immunology for help. The stress of studying for examinations can adversely affect the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. One way the immune system can be affected is by an increase in the production of cortisol, a stress hormone. Cortisol can suppress the immune system by decreasing the activity of immune cells such as lymphocytes, which are important in fighting infections. Therefore, a decreased lymphocyte count would support the hypothesis that the stress of studying for examinations is making the students more susceptible to infection.

Question: A 37-year-old man comes to the physician because of nonradiating low back pain for 3 days. The pain began after he worked in his yard. He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options: A. MRI of the spine
B. Chiropractic treatment
C. X-rays of the spine
D. Lumbar puncture
E. Surgical consultation
F. Steroid injections
G. Acupuncture
H. Regular activity
I. Bed rest
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The given symptoms suggest a possible muscle strain or sprain, which is a common cause of low back pain. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the examination shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm, limited range of motion, and negative straight-leg raising. These findings are consistent with a muscle strain or sprain.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to recommend rest, over-the-counter pain medication, and physical therapy exercises to help alleviate the pain and promote healing. MRI of the spine is not necessary for a muscle strain or sprain, and surgical consultation is not appropriate at this stage. Chiropractic treatment, acupuncture, and steroid injections may provide some relief, but they are not the most appropriate first step in management. X-rays of the spine may be considered if the pain persists or worsens, but they are not necessary for a muscle strain or sprain. Lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is regular activity, rest, over-the-counter pain medication, and physical therapy exercises.

Question: A 52-year-old woman has had dyspnea and hemoptysis for 1 month. She has a history of rheumatic fever as a child and has had a cardiac murmur since early adulthood. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?
Options: A. Aortic valve insufficiency
B. Aortic valve stenosis
C. Mitral valve insufficiency
D. Mitral valve stenosis
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the given symptoms and physical examination findings to make an educated guess about the most likely diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis, along with the irregular pulse and low blood pressure, suggest heart failure. The jugular venous pressure is not increased, which suggests that the failure is not due to right-sided heart failure. The crackles heard at the lung bases suggest pulmonary edema, which is a common complication of left-sided heart failure. The opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space is a classic finding of mitral regurgitation. The chest x-ray findings of left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement are also consistent with mitral regurgitation. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is mitral valve insufficiency (C).",1373,200,5.6261372566223145,1334.380999982357

Question: A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?
Options: A. Early Parkinson disease
B. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C. Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D. Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E. Increase in alcohol consumption

Question: A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?
Options: A. It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother
B. It is a polymorphism
C. It is a sequence variant of unknown significance
D. It will change the folding of the protein
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We know that Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene. The patient and her mother have the same single nucleotide change, but the patient has clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome while the mother does not. The single nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the single nucleotide change is likely a polymorphism, which is a common variation in the DNA sequence that does not affect the function of the gene. Therefore, the answer is (B).

It's important to note that even though the single nucleotide change is a polymorphism, it is still possible for it to have an effect on the function of the FBN1 protein in some individuals. However, in the context of this question, the single nucleotide change is not a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother.

In addition, it's worth mentioning that the fact that the patient is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight, along with the physical examination findings of a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity, are consistent with Marfan syndrome. However, the fact that molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus suggests that the mutation is not a disease-causing mutation in this case. This highlights the importance of considering both clinical and genetic evidence when making a diagnosis.",1376,342,9.562482118606567,2252.7670000195503

Question: A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was the unrestrained driver. He is conscious. Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?
Options: A. Stylomastoid foramen
B. Superior orbital fissure
C. Foramen lacerum
D. Optic canal
E. Foramen spinosum
F. Jugular foramen
G. Internal acoustic meatus
H. Foramen rotundum
I. Foramen ovale
J. Foramen magnum
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. The symptoms described in the question suggest a fracture of the zygomatic arch, orbit, and infratemporal fossa, which are located in the region of the skull known as the temporal bone. The superior orbital fissure is located in the orbit, but it does not involve the zygomatic arch or infratemporal fossa. The foramen lacerum, foramen spinosum, jugular foramen, internal acoustic meatus, foramen rotundum, and foramen ovale are located in different areas of the skull. The foramen magnum is located at the base of the skull, but it is not involved in the symptoms described. The only remaining option is the super orbital fissure (B), which is located in the temporal bone and connects the orbit with the middle cranial fossa. However, the symptoms described in the question suggest that the fracture is more extensive than just the superior orbital fissure, so it is more likely that the fracture involves the temporal bone as a whole rather than just the superior orbital fissure. Therefore, the most likely answer is (C) Foramen lacerum, which is a gap in the temporal bone that connects the middle cranial fossa with the infratemporal fossa. However, it's important to note that this is a complex injury and a thorough examination and imaging studies would be required to confirm the exact location of the fracture.

Question: Which one of these organs has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass (kg)?

Options: A. Brain
B. Kidney
C. Liver
D. Skeletal Muscle
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the basal metabolic rate (BMR) to compare the energy expenditure of different organs. The BMR is the minimum energy required to maintain vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and body temperature.

The BMR of the brain is relatively high compared to other organs because it requires a lot of energy to maintain its complex neural activity. The BMR of the kidneys is also relatively high because they are responsible for filtering the blood and maintaining the body's fluid and electrolyte balance.

The liver has a moderate BMR because it performs many important functions such as detoxification, protein synthesis, and metabolism of nutrients. Skeletal muscle has a low BMR because it is primarily used for movement and can be relatively inactive when the body is at rest.

Therefore, the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass is skeletal muscle. The answer is (D).",1178,206,5.78869104385376,1338.4329999685287

Question: Sauna use, sometimes referred to as ""sauna bathing,"" is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body's core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors… In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease… The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits – and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week… The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)…Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40°C (104°F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37°C (98.6°F, or normal) to 38°C (100.4°F) and then rapidly increasing to 39°C (102.2°F)…  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance… Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors… The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. In fact, sauna use has been proposed as an alternative to exercise for people who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations.[13]

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy and physiology for help. The larynx is a cartilaginous structure in the neck that houses the vocal folds (also known as the vocal cords). The vocal folds are controlled by several muscles, including the cricothyroid muscle and the interarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscle is responsible for adjusting the tension of the vocal folds, while the interarytenoid muscles are responsible for adducting (bringing together) and abducting (moving apart) the vocal folds.

After suspected recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction. This is because the cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoid muscles are still functional. The answer is (D).",1391,192,5.440195560455322,1261.8689999580383

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on infectious diseases and neurology for help. The symptoms described in the question are consistent with meningitis, which is an inflammation of the meninges (the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). The most common cause of meningitis in adolescents is bacterial meningitis, and the most common bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis are Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These bacteria can enter the central nervous system through the bloodstream, which can occur through direct invasion of the bloodstream or through hematogenous spread from a focus of infection elsewhere in the body. The symptoms described in the question, such as fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting, are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The presence of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests that the patient may have a protozoan infection, but this is less likely given the other symptoms and the fact that protozoan meningitis is rare in adolescents. Therefore, the most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is through the bloodstream, which can occur through direct invasion of the bloodstream or through hematogenous spread from a focus of infection elsewhere in the body. The answer is (E) Vertebral canal. However, it's important to note that this is a multiple choice question and the answer provided is the most likely one based on the information given, but it's not definitive. A definitive diagnosis would require further testing and consultation with a medical professional.",1385,351,9.833347797393799,2299.380999982357

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on virology for help. Paroviruses are highly impactful because they do not have nucleic acid. The answer is (B).

Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his babysitter because of a 30-minute history of respiratory distress. The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight. The babysitter says, ""He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy."" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%. In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options: A. Intravenous aminophylline therapy
B. Intravenous antibiotic therapy
C. Intubation
D. Oral dexamethasone therapy
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on pediatrics and emergency medicine for help. The symptoms described in the question suggest a possible case of croup, which is a common viral infection in children that causes inflammation of the larynx and trachea, leading to a characteristic barking cough and stridor (a high-pitched sound during inspiration). The child's tachypnea (rapid breathing) and low oxygen saturation despite supplemental oxygen suggest that the airway obstruction is severe.

The most appropriate next step in this case would be intubation to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation. This is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and to prevent further airway obstruction. Intravenous aminophylline therapy, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and oral dexamethasone therapy may be considered as adjunctive treatments, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this case. The answer is (C) Intubation.",1597,214,6.032496452331543,1448.841000020504

Question: A 45-year-old woman has a 2-week history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating; she was robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 μU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options: A. Generalized anxiety disorder
B. Social anxiety disorder
C. Obsessive-compulsive disorder
D. Adjustment disorder
E. Post-traumatic stress disorder
F. Hypothyroidism
G. Panic disorder
H. Agoraphobia
I. Specific phobia
J. Acute stress disorder
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","In this scenario, the patient is a minor (15 years old), and as such, her consent alone is not sufficient for medical treatment. In order to follow the correct procedure for treating a minor, the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem is to obtain written consent from at least one of her parents (Option B). This is because parents or legal guardians have the legal authority to make medical decisions for their children. It's important to note that the living situation and other circumstances of the patient may also be relevant in determining the best course of action, but in terms of obtaining consent for medical treatment, the parent or legal guardian's consent is required.",1456,143,4.0439066886901855,944.9039999842644

Question: A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options: A. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
B. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through
C. CT scan of the abdomen
D. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We can use the information provided about the patient's symptoms and physical examination to help determine the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occur after eating, extending from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and sometimes felt in the right scapula, are suggestive of gallstones or cholecystitis. The patient's BMI is also high, which increases the risk of gallstones.

Given these symptoms and the lack of other abnormalities on examination, the most appropriate next step in management would be an abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant to evaluate for gallstones or cholecystitis. This is a non-invasive and relatively quick test that can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Therefore, the answer is (A) Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant.",1376,206,5.784674167633057,1363.1110000014305

Question: If an X-linked recessive disorder is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, then the expected incidence of affected homozygous females would be _______.
Options: A. 1 in 10 000
B. 1 in 50 000
C. 1 in 5000
D. 1 in 8000
E. 1 in 1000

G. 1 in 200
H. 1 in 100 000
I. 1 in 20 000
J. 1 in 4000
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We know that X-linked recessive disorders affect males more severely because they have only one X chromosome, and if they inherit the mutated X chromosome from their mother, they will express the disorder. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so if they inherit one mutated X chromosome, they will be carriers but not affected.

In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the mutated allele (p) is equal to the square root of the frequency of affected males (q = 1/100). Since the mutated allele is recessive, the frequency of affected homozygous females (q^2) is equal to the square of the frequency of the mutated allele (p^2).

So, p = sqrt(1/100) = 0.1 and p^2 = 0.01. Therefore, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 1000. The answer is (E).",1305,232,6.5306737422943115,1513.9139999747276

Question: A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?
Options: A. 90%
B. 80%
C. 1%
D. 60%
E. 20%
F. 40%
G. 70%
H. 50%
I. 10%
J. 30%
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","In a randomized controlled trial, statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) is no more effective than the standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. The investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%, which is the significance level (alpha). They also set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%, which is the beta error or the Type II error.

To calculate the statistical power, we can use the following formula:

Power = 1 - β

where β is the probability of a Type II error. In this case, β = 0.10.

So, Power = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 or 90%.

Therefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 90%. The answer is (A).",1399,239,6.7193334102630615,1571.6640000343323

Question: A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140–200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?
Options: A. His daily glucose control is better than recorded
B. His glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced
C. His hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated
D. His sickle cell disease is affecting his hemoglobin A1c
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We have a case of a 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations range from 140–200 mg/dL, but his hemoglobin A1c is 5.4%. The patient admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently.

The hemoglobin A1c is a measure of the average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months. A normal value is less than 5.7%. A value of 5.4% indicates that the patient's average blood glucose level is lower than what is being recorded by the home fingerstick tests. This discrepancy is likely due to the patient's infrequent glucose monitoring, which may result in higher readings than his actual average blood glucose level.

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. The symptoms described in the question are consistent with sinusitis, which is often caused by bacterial infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. However, the patient's symptoms also include nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, and a nonproductive cough, which are more suggestive of a viral infection. In addition, the patient's temperature is elevated, which is more consistent with a bacterial infection. Therefore, it is difficult to definitively determine the most likely causal organism based on the information provided. However, given the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has not been exposed to any known bacterial pathogens, it is possible that the sinusitis is viral in origin. The answer is not definitive, but it is possible that the causal organism is a virus such as Rhinovirus or Influenza virus.",1436,212,5.966339826583862,1410.3429999947548

Question: A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?
Options: A. Decreasing myocardial contractility
B. Dilating the coronary arteries
C. Peripheral vasodilation
D. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs
Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on cardiology for help. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is experiencing chest pain on exertion, which suggests that he may have coronary artery disease. A β-adrenergic blocking agent works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart, which helps to reduce the heart rate, decrease myocardial contractility, and dilate peripheral blood vessels. This can help to reduce the workload on the heart and improve symptoms of angina. Therefore, the most likely mechanism by which treatment with a β-adrenergic blocking agent would improve the patient's symptoms is by decreasing myocardial contractility (Option A). The answer is (A).",1301,183,5.157973051071167,1210.0869999527931

Answer: Let's think step by step.

","We refer to Wikipedia articles on biochemistry for help. The end-product of glycolysis in all cells is pyruvate, except for red blood cells, where it is lactate. The answer is (J).

In red blood cells, glycolysis continues even in the absence of oxygen, producing ATP through anaerobic respiration. The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is lactate, not pyruvate. The answer is (J).

In all other cells, glycolysis requires oxygen to continue through aerobic respiration, where pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and enters the citric acid cycle. The answer is (J).

Glycolysis requires ATP, NAD+, and several enzymes to proceed. The answer is not (B) or (F).

Glucagon increases the rate of glucose production by the liver, not the rate of glycolysis. The answer is not (G).

The answer is not (I) because glucagon increases the rate of glucose production, not the rate of glycolysis.

The answer is not (H) because NAD+ is a coenzyme required in glycolysis, not NADP+.

The answer is not (E) because glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products, not two molecules of fructose.

The answer is not (D) because glycolysis can occur in the absence of oxygen, but aerobic respiration requires oxygen.

The answer is not (C) because parvoviruses are not parasites that can survive in extreme temperatures.

The answer is not (A) because parvoviruses do not alter the host's DNA.
