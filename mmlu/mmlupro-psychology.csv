Question: A 7-year-old student arrived in the United States one year ago from a non-Englishspeaking country, where she achieved high scores in reading. Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class.

She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?
Options: A.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.

H. The student's reading difficulty is due to lack of interest in the subject matter in the basal reader.
I. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.
