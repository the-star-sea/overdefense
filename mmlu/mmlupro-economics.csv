Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Explain why the average fixed cost curve (AFC) slopes down-ward throughout, while the average variable cost curve (AVC) slopes down at first, but then turns upward.
Options: A. The AFC slopes downward due to a decrease in demand for the product, while the AVC slopes upward from the start due to increasing variable costs.
B. The AFC slopes upward as quantity increases
C. The AFC slopes downward because it represents the spread of fixed costs over an increasing number of units, while the AVC initially decreases due to a fixed proportion of inputs and then increases as variable input prices rise.
D. The AVC turns upward due to an increase in fixed inputs
E. The AFC slopes downward as quantity increases because of increased efficiency in production, while the AVC initially decreases due to underutilization of variable inputs and then increases because of market forces.
F. The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the average fixed cost per unit decreases. The AVC slopes down at first due to fuller utilization of the fixed inputs and the extension of specialization but then turns upward due to the law of diminishing returns.
G. The AFC remains constant throughout because it is independent of output, and the AVC slopes downward indefinitely as economies of scale are realized.
H. The AFC slopes downward because as quantity increases, the total fixed cost is spread over more units. The AVC initially falls due to technological advances, but then rises because of increased labor costs.
I. The AVC always slopes downwards
J. Both the AFC and AVC slope downward as quantity increases due to continuous improvements in production technology and efficiency.

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55

H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55

H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55

H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Why is a retail sales tax of 4% not proportional but regressive?
Options: A. The 4% retail sales tax decreases in percentage as the amount spent on consumption increases.
B. The 4% retail sales tax is regressive because it applies only to luxury goods, which lower income groups do not purchase.
C. The 4% retail sales tax is a flat tax, so it affects all income groups equally.
D. Lower income groups receive a subsidy that offsets the 4% retail sales tax.
E. Higher income groups pay more retail sales tax because they have more income.
F. Higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate with the 4% retail sales tax.
G. Lower income groups are exempt from the 4% retail sales tax.

Question: Adam Smith relied on the workings of the profit motive in his theory of the 'invisible hand'. Yet, at the same time, he attacked businessmen for their attempts at 'conspiracy against the public'. How did Smith reconcile hiseconomic system with the greed of some businessmen? Would hecall for government intervention in order to break up these conspiracies ?
Options: A. Smith thought that the fear of public backlash and loss of reputation would keep businesses from engaging in conspiracies.
B. Smith believed in the unchecked profit motive.
C. Smith called for government intervention in business.
D. Smith believed that competition could regulate and control the profit motive, preventing price-fixing conspiracies. He would not call for government intervention.
E. Smith felt that moral sentiments would naturally discourage businessmen from conspiracies without requiring government intervention.
F. Smith advocated for strict regulations on business practices to prevent any form of conspiracy against the public.
G. Smith supported legal monopolies.
H. Smith trusted in a self-regulating economy where market forces would dissolve monopolies without any external interference.
I. Smith argued that consumers' choices would be enough to disrupt any attempts at a conspiracy against the public.
J. Smith suggested that the natural cycle of economic booms and busts would prevent long-term conspiracies and monopolistic practices.

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: What is the law of diminishing marginal utility?
Options: A. This principle suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the total utility decreases.
B. The law asserts that the marginal utility of a good increases at a decreasing rate as consumption increases.
C. The law suggests that utility does not change with consumption and remains static over time.
D. It states that each additional unit of consumption yields greater utility than the previous one, indefinitely.
E. It's a rule that says the first unit of a good or service consumed yields the least utility.
F. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility refers to the fact that as successive units are consumed, the utility derived from each additional unit decreases beyond some point.
G. It indicates that the utility derived from each additional unit consumed remains constant no matter how many units are consumed.
H. It's the principle that states that as the quantity of a good decreases, the utility derived from each additional unit increases.
I. The law states that utility increases with each unit consumed.
J. The law claims that consumers derive equal utility from each additional unit consumed, regardless of the quantity already consumed.

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55

I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25

I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Why is it that the banking system as a whole can produce a multiple expansion of deposits while a single bank within that system cannot?
Options: A. The expansion of deposits is regulated by a central authority that dictates the exact amount each bank can lend.
B. Each bank is required to convert all deposits into long-term investments, eliminating the potential for deposit expansion.
C. Banks operate independently without any interbank transactions, so deposits in one bank do not influence another.
D. The deposit expansion only occurs within one bank.
E. Banks do not need to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves.
F. Each bank within the system retains all deposits without lending, preventing any expansion of deposits.
G. The banking system can produce a multiple expansion of deposits because when loans from one bank become deposits in other banks, these deposits are partly used to make new loans, increasing total deposits in banks taken together by a multiple of the increase in the deposits of any one of them.
H. Each bank can lend out the entire amount of its deposits.
I. Single banks can lend an unlimited amount without affecting the overall banking system's deposit levels.
J. The banking system relies on a single reserve that is shared equally among all banks, ensuring uniform deposit expansion.

unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?
(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: The ABC Pencil Co. was considering a price increase and wished to determine the elasticity of demand. An economist and a market researcher, Key and Worce, were hired to study demand. In a controlled experiment, it was determined that at 8\textcent, 100 pencils were sold yielding an elasticity of 2.25. However, key and worce were industrial spies, employed by the EF Pencil Co. And sent to ABC to cause as much trouble as possible. So key and worce decided to change the base for their elasticity figure, measuring price in terms of dollars instead of pennies ( i.e., $.08 for 8\textcent and $.10 for 10\textcent ). How will this sabotage affect the results?
Options: A. The calculated elasticity will appear much higher, misleading the company
B. The change in base will create an illusion of inelastic demand
C. The elasticity measure will decrease
D. The price point for maximum revenue will appear to change dramatically
E. Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.
F. The price-demand curve will shift to the right
G. The elasticity measure will increase
H. The calculated elasticity will seem artificially low, causing confusion in pricing strategy
I. The sabotage will significantly affect the results
J. The demand will seem more elastic than it actually is

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Mr. A owns 1,000 shares of General Electric common stock. If he tries to sell some, he finds he can get a price of $61.50 per share for all 1,000 shares. If he offers only 500 shares, he can get a price of $61,625 which is $0,125 more per share. That is, reducing his amount sold by a half, he can get a price that is higher by about 1/500. If he sought a price of $61.75, he would sell nothing. Mr. A considers this an insignificant rise in price as a result of withholding his supply. Is this an example of a price-takers' market?

The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2

I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Neoclassical economists developed a production function in which all the factors of production (land, capital, labor) received the value of their marginal product; that is, the interest paid to capital equals the contribution capital makes to the product, wages paid to labor equals the value of the marginal product of labor, etc. Some economists suggested that this result showed that the distribution of free, competitive capitalism is morally right and just. Whatis wrong with this suggestion?
Options: A. Assumes that ownership of resources means the owner is entitled to all the benefits
B. It underestimates the value of labor
C. It overlooks the historical and social factors that affect the distribution of resources
D. It assumes perfect competition and complete information, which are rarely present in real markets
E. It ignores the potential for market power to influence the distribution of income
F. It assumes that the market always operates efficiently without any externalities
G. It overvalues the contribution of capital
H. It contradicts the socialist view

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

B. Marx computes the value of skilled labor from training costs and measures it in terms of units of unskilled labor. He averages differences in natural abilities into the term 'socially necessary labor'.
C. Marx equalizes the value of all commodities by the average amount of labor, without considering individual skill differences.
D. Marx ignores the varied skills and natural abilities of people.
E. Marx believes that the value of a commodity is determined solely by the skill level of the labor.
F. Marx suggests that natural abilities are irrelevant, as all labor is inherently equal in the creation of value.
G. Marx treats the value of labor as a reflection of the social status of the laborer, rather than the labor itself.
H. Marx uses only the most skilled labor as a benchmark for determining the value of a commodity.
I. Marx attributes a fixed value to each type of labor regardless of skill level or natural ability.
J. Marx proposes that the market adjusts the value of commodities according to the rarity of the skills required to produce them.

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).

Question: Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance
yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut
The (unconditional) mean of y will be given by
Options: A. 0.45
B. 0.2
C. 0.4
D. 0.1
E. 0.3
F. 0.55
G. 0.25
H. 0.33
I. 0.6
J. 0.5
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (H) 0.33. The answer is (H).
