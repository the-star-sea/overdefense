Question: Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?
Options: A. National governments should take a more active role in securing energy resources, potentially through the nationalization of energy companies.
B. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.
C. The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.
D. The concept of energy security is a construct of the capitalist system and should be rejected in favor of a more equitable distribution of resources.
E. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.
F. Energy security is best ensured through the privatization of energy resources, allowing for a free-market competition to drive innovation and efficiency.
G. Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.
H. Energy security is not a major concern, as technological advancements will continue to provide new ways to generate energy.

Question: In what ways may TNC be regarded as a new concept?
Options: A. Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.
B. Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.
C. Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.
D. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.

Question: What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?
Options: A. There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.
B. Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.
C. Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.
D. Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.

Question: In what ways is a fusion nuclear device different from a fission device?
Options: A. Fusion weapons use both fission and fusion reactions in a three-stage process to produce a limited energy explosion with high thermal energy.
B. A fusion device involves a two-stage process where an implosion device triggers a series of fusion reactions, resulting in a high energy explosion with limited thermal energy.
C. Fusion weapons have unlimited destructive capacity because they can be precision calculated, while fission weapons have limited destructive capacity because their energy output depends on the mass of the material used.
D. Fusion weapons have a highly specific destructive effect. The heavier element produced from a fissions reaction, and the difference in mass from the two lighter nuclei (which is translated into an energy explosion) can be precision calculated. Bombs even within the multi-megaton range have unlimited military utility, their destructive capability can be manufactured according to the target.
E. A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential.
F. Fusion devices are single-stage bombs that use a fission reaction to trigger a fusion reaction, leading to a high energy explosion with limited thermal energy.
G. A fusion device is a two-stage process where a gun-type device is used to trigger a series of fission reactions with the cumulative result being the production of a high energy flash explosion with unlimited thermal energy.
H. Fusion devices use the principle of splitting heavy elements to generate energy, while fission devices combine light elements to release energy.
I. A fusion reaction is created when the nuclei of two light elements are combined, the reaction resulting in heavier elements fragmenting into smaller parts. This fragmentation releases energy of limited destructive capacity, the extent of energy released dependent on the mass of material used.
J. A fusion weapon is a four-stage-bomb that uses a gun-type device to create a fission reaction, which then triggers a fusion reaction. The weapon has a specific destructive effect.

Question: What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?
Options: A. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty argue that humanitarian intervention is an essential tool for maintaining global security, and hence should be supported by all states.
B. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.
C. The Westphalian model of sovereignty promotes the idea of shared responsibility, arguing that states have a duty to intervene in a humanitarian crisis, regardless of the sovereignty of the affected state.
D. In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.
E. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.
F. Westphalian sovereignty supports the idea of humanitarian intervention only when it is requested by the state in question.
G. The Westphalian concept of sovereignty emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and hence supports the idea of humanitarian intervention under the supervision of international bodies.
H. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.
I. Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention are not related, as the former is a political concept and the latter is a social one.

Question: What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC?
Options: A. Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.
B. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.
C. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.
D. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.

Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.
F. Strong states do not face the risk of conflict due to environmental changes, as they have the ability to mitigate the effects of these changes.
G. The environmental security agenda for strong states is not concerned with conflict, as these states have sufficient resources to manage environmental changes.

Question: Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?
Options: A. The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.
B. The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.
C. The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.
D. Weak states can become strong by adopting autocratic forms of governance and suppressing internal dissent.
E. The security dilemma of weak states can be solved by pooling their resources and forming regional security alliances.
F. Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status. Long term security strategies have resulted in the adoption of measures to counteract the worst of the effects including the establishment of multi parties, economic liberalization and membership of the international community.
G. The weak state security dilemma is a myth, propagated by strong states to maintain global hegemony.
H. The international community has largely ignored the security dilemma of weak states, focusing instead on expanding global trade networks.
I. Weak states are not inherently insecure; it's their handling and response to security threats that determine their stability.
J. The rise of non-state actors like transnational corporations and international non-governmental organizations has effectively made the concept of state security obsolete.

Question: Which of the following statements best describes the characteristics of a weak state?
Options: A. Weak states are characterized by a high level of social-political cohesion and a strong monopoly over the instruments of violence. The regime is often legitimized through the use of force.
B. Weak states have a well-developed bureaucracy and are able to enforce their policies through a cohesive social-political structure. They often rely on the legitimacy of the regime to maintain control.
C. Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm.
D. Weak states have strong military capabilities and maintain absolute loyalty from the armed forces. They frequently intervene in social matters to maintain control.
E. Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.
F. Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.
G. Weak states have a monopoly over social actors and are able to maintain control through the use of force. They also have well-equipped and well-managed armed forces.
H. The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.

B. Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable.

Question: To what extent can societal identity be defended militarily?
Options: A. If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required.

B. Intra-state collectives faced with a political or military threat to their identity will form their own militia or defensive force as a means of protection. This results in the establishment of quasi-states which may undermine the territorial integrity of the nation.
C. Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces (in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.
D. Societal groups do not face military threats; being constituted by identity and social cohesion, military forces are not engaged against societal groups in any meaningful way.

Question: In what ways is defining coercive diplomacy success problematic?

C. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.
D. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.

Question: What is the future of WMD?
Options: A. The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.
B. The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
C. Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.
D. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.

Question: In what ways is it possible to gain a definition of terrorism?
Options: A. A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals.

Random acts of violence contribute to the sense of insecurity and societal instability.
D. Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives. The definition may therefore be inclusive of governments as targets or perpetrators and cases of war (hot and cold) where terror and counter-terror measures are tactics of either side.

Question: In what ways might international measures be employed? Are they a help or a hindrance?
Options: A. Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.
B. Countries often resist international measures out of concerns over sovereignty. This can limit the effectiveness of these measures and hinder international cooperation against terrorism.
C. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.
D. Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures.

Question: What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?
Options: A. The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.
B. The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.
C. The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.
D. Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence. Social disquiet is a semi-permanent situation of emergent but not developed anarchy.

Question: To what extent and to what effect has the environment been securitized?
Options: A. Environmental security has been largely disregarded by policymakers and is not seen as a high-priority issue.
B. Environmental security has led to a 'trading off' of military security for environmental security with the allocation of resources committed to solving environmental problems. A particular emphasis has been placed on environmental change as the cause of violent conflict and addressing environmental threats from other factors than domestic causes.
C. The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.
D. The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered as an issue of high security politics.
E. The 'securitization' of the environment has led to a significant increase in funding and resources allocated to environmental protection and conservation efforts.
F. The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security.
G. The securitization of environmental issues has led to a reduction in the importance placed on other areas of security.
H. The environment has been 'securitized' to the extent that it has become a central focus of military strategy and planning.

Question: How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?
Options: A. Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.
B. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.
C. Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.
D. Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.

Question: To what extent have biological agents been weaponized?
Options: A. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.
B. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.
C. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.
D. Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic. Vaccination capabilities have undermined calls for the weaponization of viral agents made by some military strategists as most public health authorities have in place programs to deal with a possible outbreak.

Question: In what ways will the changing global security environment shape the nature of developing conflicts in the twenty-first century?
Options: A. Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.
B. Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.
C. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.
D. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.

Question: In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?
Options: A. Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.
B. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.
C. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.
D. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.

Question: How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?
Options: A. Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.
B. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.
C. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.
D. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.

Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?
Options: A. Peace researchers and realists were in full agreement on the focus of their studies, both advocating for a reduction in nuclear arms as the best path to peace.
B. Although peace researchers were critical of the realist focus on military strength, both groups agreed that the Soviet bloc posed a significant threat to Western liberal democracies.
C. Realists and peace researchers shared the same views and advocated for disarmament and peaceful coexistence as the best way to resolve the East-West divide of the Cold War.
D. Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.
E. The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.
F. Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.
G. Realists and peace researchers had a common goal of promoting peace, but differed significantly in their approaches, with the former advocating for military supremacy and the latter for diplomacy and negotiation.
H. The realist school and peace researchers had minor disagreements on their study agendas, but both believed in the importance of maintaining a balance of power to achieve security.

Question: What problems has the post-Cold War security literature revealed on women, war, development, and security?
Options: A. Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.
B. The technological capacity to wage war with minimal civilian costs has abolished the threat of physical and biological gender victimization. The contemporary gender divide is structured on 'soft' issues associated with socio-economic hardship.
C. Conflict in warfare and the gender divide between men and women is centred on the historical contract between the individual and the state. The 'right to fight' debate has equal meaning and saliency across the globe, and is universally applicable in all situations.
D. Nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction have rendered the battlefield gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities. Whilst historically conventional warfare was conducted on the battlefield in which women were particularly vulnerable to violence, and post-conflict sexual violence, these threats no longer exist.
