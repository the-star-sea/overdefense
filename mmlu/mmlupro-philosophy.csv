Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question:  Which of the following statements best describes Gill's response to the argument that the Oregon physician-assisted law falsely assumes that doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living?
Options: A. Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.
B. The law is in line with the doctors' Hippocratic oath of doing no harm.
C. Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.

E. The argument is valid because doctors should not be the ones to decide whether a life is worth living.

H. The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
Obviously, (B) is the best symbolization of the original sentence. The answer is (B).

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)

Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.

Question: Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Turtles live long lives and are happy creatures, unless they are injured.
Options: A. (L • H) ≡ I
B. (L • H) ∨ I
C. L • (H ∨ I)
D. L • (H ⊃ R).
Answer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. Let “L” denote “living long”, H “being happy”, and “I” “being injured”. Now, consider each choice:
(A) means (living long AND being happy) is equivalent to (being injured). 
(B) means (living long AND being happy) OR (being injured). 
(C) means (living long) AND (being happy OR being injured). 
(D) means (living long) AND (being happy implies being R), but what R denotes is not clear.
